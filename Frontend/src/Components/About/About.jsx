          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Sabor Casero was founded in 1995 as a small family restaurant with the dream
            of sharing traditional recipes that had been passed down through generations.
            What began as a family adventure has become one of the
            city's most beloved restaurants.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our philosophy is simple: fresh ingredients, authentic recipes, and
            warm service that makes every guest feel at home. Each dish
            we serve is prepared with the same love and care that we would put
            into our own family table.
